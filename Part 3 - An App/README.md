# Part 3 - An App

Now we put it all together into an interactive web app, powered by the network graph toolkit we've been developing 

**Tasks**

1. Play with `dash-cytoscape` and build a simple visualization with a subset of data
2. Apply some simple styles to the data
2. Add in some interactive components to allow us to choose the attributes that connect and style the graph

* Get started in the [**Workbook**](https://github.dev/lucasdurand/network-graph-tutorial/blob/develop/Part%203%20-%20An%20App/Workbook.ipynb)


**Extras**

4. Add additional inputs to allow the full flexibility of the `px_plot_nx` function we made earlier
4. Visualize the communities we detected
5. Add pagination / better scaling for larger graphs
